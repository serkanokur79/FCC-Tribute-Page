        Cahit Arf was born in Thessaloniki which, in 1910, was a part of the Ottoman Empire. However, the Balkan War was fought by Serbia, Bulgaria, Greece, and Montenegro against the Ottoman Empire when Arf was two years old. Montenegro declared war on Turkey on 8 October 1912, and the other members of the Balkan league declared war on Turkey 10 days later. The Balkan allies were soon victorious. The Bulgarians defeated the main Ottoman forces, advancing towards Istanbul (then called Constantinople), and the Greeks occupied Thessaloniki. With the outbreak of fighting, Arf's family escaped to Istanbul.
        </p>
        <p>
        In 1919 Arf's family moved again, this time to Ankara, but they returned to Istanbul for a short period before they finally settled in Izmir. Cahit Arf's interest in mathematics was stimulated during his school years in Izmir by a teacher who encouraged him to solve problems in euclidean geometry. In 1926 Arf's father bought French francs when the currency was devalued and it became a cheaper option for the family to send Arf to school in France. Arf won a scholarship to continued his education in Paris and he returned to France, graduating from the École Normale Supérieure after spending two years there.
        </p>
        <p>Returning to Istanbul to be a school teacher rather than to complete his doctorate, Arf taught at the Galatasaray High School during 1932.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <em>I was going to take the place of a teacher from France ... and do the work that he did. My salary was 60 Turkish Liras but the person whom I took the place of was getting paid 600 Turkish Liras.... I worked as an idealist for a year. Some teachers felt sorry for me. They were saying "poor him. ... He is working for 60 Liras". Probably because of that, I lost my idealism. ... At that time reforms were being made in universities so they offered me a position as an assistant professor. I accepted it and then I thought myself that I was successful.</em><br>
          &#8722;<cite>Cahit Arf</cite>
        </blockquote>
        <p>In 1933 he joined the Mathematics Department of Istanbul University. In 1937 he went to Göttingen, where he received his PhD from the University of Göttingen and he worked with Helmut Hasse and Josue Cruz de Munoz. </p>
        <p>He returned to Istanbul University and worked there until his involvement with the foundation work of Scientific and Technological Research Council (TÜBİTAK) upon President Cemal Gursel's appointment in 1962.</p>
        <p>After serving as the founding director of the council in 1963, he joined the Mathematics Department of Robert College in Istanbul. </p>
        <p>Arf spent the period of 1964–1966 working at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey. He later visited University of California, Berkeley for one year.</p>
        <p>Upon his final return to Turkey, he joined the Mathematics Department of the Middle East Technical University and continued his studies there until his retirement in 1980.</p>
        <p>Arf died on December 26, 1997 in Bebek, Istanbul, at the age of 87.</p>

      <p>Arf's influence on Science in general and Mathematics in particular was profound. Although he had very few formal students, many of the mathematicians of Turkey, at some time of their careers, had fruitful discussions on their field of interest with him and had received support and encouragement.</p>
      <p>He facilitated the now-celebrated visit of Robert Langlands to Turkey (now famous for the Langlands program, among many other things); during which Langlands worked out some arduous calculations on the epsilon factors of Artin L-functions.</p>
      <p>Middle East Technical University Department of Mathematics organizes a special lecture session called the Cahit Arf lecture each year in memory of Arf.</p>
